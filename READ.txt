use command: python setup.py install
This will allow you to import the module anywhere on ur pc.
minheap includes, a class MinHeap, and class methods insert, delete, size, and min. 
In the constructor for a MinHeap object, specify the capacity of the minheap with an integer.
You can uninstall the module in the terminal with pip.
the command is: pip uninstall minheap

*Edit: I just added a string method to show the heap in the visual representation of a list in python.
You can use it just like a normal __str__ method for the MinHeap class.
