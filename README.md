# minheap

UO CS 299 23S project

We will create a minheap (priority queue implemented as a binary heap)
and then transform it into a CPython extension. 

### CS 299 expectations: 

* Jump in and do what you can. Be brave.
* But don't do it all.  Share it with classmates.
* If you don't feel like you can write any functional C code yet,
  read your classmates' code and ask questions.

### Collaboration protocols

* If you write or modify a function, write tests
  for it. 
* Pull and test before you push. 
* Push to main.  (No branch/merge or pull requests
  at this time.  We might need to adopt them later.)
* Write good comments (enough to understand what
  you did, but brevity is the soul of wit even in code.)
